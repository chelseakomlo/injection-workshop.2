# Injection Workshop, part 2

## [Getting started as a facilitator](README-facilitator.md)

## Purpose

The first injection workshop covered SQL injection in detail. However, injection
vulnerabilities can exist anywhere user input is included in code or
instructions that are interpreted.

This workshop is a presentation that goes into further detail about other types
of common injection flaws.

It covers:
* Path traversal
* Shell (command) injection
* Shellshock
* HTTP header injection
* JavaScript injection
